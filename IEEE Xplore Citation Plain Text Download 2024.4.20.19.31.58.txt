H. Garg and M. Dave, "Securing IoT Devices and SecurelyConnecting the Dots Using REST API and Middleware," 2019 4th International Conference on Internet of Things: Smart Innovation and Usages (IoT-SIU), Ghaziabad, India, 2019, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/IoT-SIU.2019.8777334.Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) is a fairly disruptive technology with inconceivable growth, impact, and capability. We present the role of REST API in the IoT Systems and some initial concepts of IoT, whose technology is able to record and count everything. We as well highlight the concept of middleware that connects these devices and cloud. The appearance of new IoT applications in the cloud has brought new threats to security and privacy of data. Therefore it is required to introduce a secure IoT system which doesn't allow attackers infiltration in the network through IoT devices and also to secure data in transit from IoT devices to cloud. We provide the details on how Representational State Transfer (REST) API allows to securely expose connected devices to applications on cloud and users. In the proposed model, middleware is primarily used to expose device data through REST and to hide details and act as an interface to the user to interact with sensor data. keywords: {Internet of Things;Middleware;Logic gates;Authentication;Cloud computing;Authorization;IoT;security;REST API;middleware},URL:Â https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777334&isnumber=8777333
